1. Create next app

6. Add the form to add todo page and make the necessary changes. 
7. import useState hook and create states.  
7.1 Create the mongoose Schema.
    1. We will have to add mongoose.models = {}. If we don't it will throw an error that once model is compiled we won't be able to overwrite it.
    2. The line resets the mongoose.models to an empty object, like this: mongoose.models = {}. This will remove all the models from the mongoose.models object.
