                <p>Man has landed on the Moon. A new era in his history began at 9.18 last night when the lunar module Eagle settled gently on the dusty surface of the Sea of Tranquiluty. Inside it-Astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin, destined now for a permanent place in history. They immediately began to prepare for their Moon walk. There are still great perils ahead. But these are truly great achievements. America, the land of the frontier men has opened up a new frontier.</p>
