// This line imports the NextAuth function from the "next-auth/next" module. The NextAuth function is the main function provided by NextAuth.js that handles authentication requests.

const handler = (req, res) => NextAuth(req, res, authOptions)
//Defines a function called handler. The handler function takes in a standard request and response objects provided by Next.js API routes. The handler function then calls the NextAuth function with these request and response objects, along with the authOptions Object which I will create shortly.

}
//Module.exports, export an object that defines the API route, GET and POST, both of which have the value of the handler function. The same handler function will be used to handle both GET and POST requests to the API route.
