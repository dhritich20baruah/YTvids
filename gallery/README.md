Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

The designs are in image formats (sketch and figma designs coming soon).

You will find all the required assets in the `/assets` folder. These include images, fonts, etc.

There is also a `style-guide.html` file containing the information you'll need, such as color palette and font names. Make sure to open this in the browser to see the contents.
